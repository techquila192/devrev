# DevFlow Enhancer

This repository provides telephony support for the Devrev platform and automates optimized issue and ticket management.
The snap-in operates in the following sequence of events:- 
- The customer calls the Twilio number to lodge a complaint or problem that they are facing. 
- A ticket is automatically generated containing relevant details of the call. Following ticket generation, issues are created or pre-existing issues are linked with the ticket.
- The support executive can also further communicate with the customer using a custom command which provides end-to-end privacy.
- The snap-in also automates efficient issue grouping if a ticket is manually created in the Devrev platform.

This application utilizes the custom snap-in API which can be accessed here:-
